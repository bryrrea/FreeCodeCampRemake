## **INTRO**  
**Welcome to this repo!** I hope you are all fine!  
My name is Bryan. I'm a newly graduated Biochemical Engineer, and I live in Brazil. I decided to start studying front-end web development over a month ago, and one of the materials I'm using is the Free Code Camp course ["New Responsive Web Design"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). So I had the idea to recreate the projects from the course, and this repo was born.  

## **Objective**  
I want to recreate the projects as part of my study process, giving "my touch" to each one.  

## **Table of content**  
Here I will create a link to the code of each project, and to the CodePen too.  

|**PROJECT**|**LINK**|**CODEPEN**|
|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|
| Cafe Menu |[CafeMenu](./Projects/01-CafeMenu/index.html)|[CodePen](https://codepen.io/dotcodevlab/details/OJELzyb)|  

>NOTE: I will probably use things a little more "advanced" than what is shown in the first projects of Free Code Camp, because I am "curious" and already had some knowledge in CSS. However, these are things that any beginner can learn in 30 minutes of study. I will try to add in the readme of each project what I have added.
